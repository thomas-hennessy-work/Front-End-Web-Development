        Dota is an abreviation for Defence of the Aincients. Dota 2's predacesor, unserprisingly named Dota, was a modified version of another game, Warcraft 3. The modification gained
        popularity in the warcraft comunity. A large number of the heros in the modern Dota 2 originated from the days of becoming
        a modification of Warcraft 3, including Juggernaught (originaly Yaniro), Natures prophit (originaly Furion) and Underlord
